            <h2>
                What Makes us The Best Bilingual Wedding DJ in Houston?
            </h2>
            <p>
                During the booking process, a great wedding DJ asks a lot of questions. One that is interested in your vision for your wedding. We ask questions like what’s your vision for your wedding. Even if you don’t know at the time. A simple answer like, ” I just want everyone to dance,” or “I just want to enjoy my day with my family,” or even “I just want a DJ to do what I tell him to do.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s our job as professionals to make suggestions on how we can help you achieve that goal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What you want to avoid is the DJ that “Knows it All.” There is a difference between knowledge and arrogance. An arrogant DJ will not be open to your ideas and will ultimately, do what’s best for him, not you, the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day of the event, a great DJ will arrive super early to set up. He or she must have the proper music already loaded into his music player or computer. Provide adequate equipment for the size of the venue. Dress properly for the occasion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the event starts, a great DJ wedding DJ will run through the wedding reception program. The DJ should be friendly to the guests and accommodating to any person that comes up to him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A great wedding DJ will also have a proven track record and organic reviews of past events he’s done. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because we follow this model, that makes us the Best Wedding DJ in Houston, and your best option for a fun wedding reception.
